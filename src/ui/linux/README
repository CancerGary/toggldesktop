To start Toggl Track, please run the script

	TogglTrack.sh

It will automatically set up the Qt library paths
and then start the app.


Should you experience any problems, please contact the Toggl
Desktop app developers at:

	support@toggl.com

Or create a new Github issue directly, by visiting:

	https://github.com/toggl/toggltrack/issues/new

If you're able to run the Toggl Track app, then you
can also send feedback directly from the app itself.
In that case, log files are automatically included with
the feedback to resolve the issue faster.
